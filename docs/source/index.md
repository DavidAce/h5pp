# h5pp

`h5pp` is a high-level C++17 wrapper for the [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) C library.

With simplicity in mind, `h5pp` lets users store common C++ data types into portable binary [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) files.
In particular, `h5pp` makes it easy to read and write [**Eigen**](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) matrices and tensors.
